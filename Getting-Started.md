# Getting Started
To get started with Emerald AI, it is recommended that you have the most recent version installed in your projects. Ensure that you always have a backup of your project before updating to a newer version of Emerald AI. Note: If you are updating from a previous version of Emerald AI, double check the update's Release Notes to ensure there are no special instructions.



# Example Scenes
One of the best ways to get started with Emerald AI is to test the examples scenes. These scenes have examples of AI that have already been setup with animations, attacks, sounds, and more. It is recommended that you test these scenes prior to creating your own AI so you can get a grasp of the Editor and how it works. While testing the example scenes, feel free to tweak the settings to get a solid understanding on how everything works.

## AI vs AI
An example of two AI of opposing factions fighting each other. The AI will only attack the player if the player attacks them first.
 
## Companion Example
An example of a Companion AI that follows the player around. It will attack any opposing AI that tries to attack the player.
 
## Destination Example
An example of two Destination based AI attempting to reach their destination. If any opposing AI gets in their way, they will fight said AI then resume traveling to their destination once the opponent has been defeated.
 
## Move to Mouse Position
An example of having controllable AI. The player can Left Click on an AI to select it then click again somewhere on the terrain for the AI to move to that location. If an AI get near the enemy AI, they will automatically attack it then continue to their destination after it has been killed.
 
## Playable Demo
An example of a few different features working together in a game-like environment. The player can press the 1 key to spawn companion AI to help them fight other AI.
 
## Raycast Hit AI
An example where the player is a camera that the AI can attack. The player object is based on the ground so the AI can attack it. The camera fires a raycast, when pressing the left mouse button, at the position of the mouse so the player can damage the AI.
 
## Tamable AI Example
An example of the ability to tame an AI. The player can walk towards the Forest Golem in the distance of the scene and tame it by pressing F before it turns hostile against them. Once the AI has been tamed, its UI and name will be updated. After this happens, the player can attack other AI in the scene and their new companion will help them.
 
## Territorial AI Example
An example of a territorial AI. When the player approaches the AI, it will look at the player for about 6 seconds before turning aggressive and attacking. If the player leaves the AI's territory before the AI turns aggressive, the AI will resume wandering.
 
## Waypoint Example
An example of an AI using the Waypoint Wander Type. The AI has manually placed waypoints that it will randomly move between. The AI will idle according to its Idle Seconds each time it reaches a new waypoint.
