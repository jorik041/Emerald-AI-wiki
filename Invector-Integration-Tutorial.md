# Invector Integration Tutorial
This tutorial will get Emerald AI working with Invector Third Person Controller. This will allow users to use Invector TPC to damage Emerald AI agents with melee damage, ranged damage, and explosive damage. It also allows Emerald AI agents to damage the Invector TPC player with block support. Note: This tutorial requires adding a few lines to a couple Invector TPC scripts and some basic understanding of minor editing of scripts. In order for Emerald AI to work correctly, your scenes must be baked with Unity’s NavMesh. 

For a quick guide on how to do so, see Unity’s guide here: Setting up and Baking Unity’s Nav Mesh. Your AI’s attack animations will also need to have Attack Animation Events for ranged/melee attacks. See the tutorial on doing this here: Attack Animation Event Tutorial
