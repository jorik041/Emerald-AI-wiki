# Setting Up an AI’s Optimization Settings
Emerald has additional options to help further optimize your AI. This can help improve performance without having to sacrifice quality. This is achieved by disabling AI when they cannot be seen by the camera. It is recommended that this is handled during the initial setup process using the Emerald Setup Manager, but if this step was missed, it can be enabled with these steps.

## Step 1 
To enable the optimization feature, go to the AI’s Settings tab and then the Optimize section. You must have Disable when Off-Screen enabled for this feature to work.

## Step 2
By default, an AI will be disabled instantly when is not visible by the camera. While this works for most game types, it might not for some. There is an additional option to have a delay before an AI is deactivated called Deactivate Delay. This lets you customize the seconds before an AI gets disabled after not being visible from the users set amount of seconds.

## Step 3 
If your AI’s model has multiple LODs, you will need to set Has Multiple LODs to Yes. The optimization feature will not work properly if your AI has more than 1 LOD level. After you have done this, you will see additional options become visible. It is recommended that you use the Auto Grab LODs feature. This will automatically grab all of your AI’s model’s LODs and apply the needed settings. After you have pressed said button, there is nothing further you need to do. Emerald will have the optimize feature set for all of your AI’s LODs.
