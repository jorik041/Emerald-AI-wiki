# Setting up and Baking Unity’s NavMesh
In order for your AI to be able to navigate through a scene, they need to have Unity’s Nav Mesh system baked to it. A guide on how to do this can be found here: [Baking your Scene with Unity's NavMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/nav-BuildingNavMesh.html). Every object you want to be included within the Nav Mesh baking must be marked as static. Marking an object as static can be found here: Marking an Object as Static
