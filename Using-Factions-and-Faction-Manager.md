# Factions and Faction Manager
The Faction Manager allows users to create and remove factions that are globally available for AI to use. Factions will be available through the Emerald AI Editor to assign to your AI agents. You can also assign the relation of each faction to determine who is an enemy, an ally, or neutral.

## Creating a Faction with the Faction Manager
First, you will need to open the Faction Manager. This can be done by pressing Ctrl+Shift+R or by gong to Window>Emerald AI>Faction Manager within Unity. To create a new faction, simply type out a faction in the Faction Name area and press “Add Faction”. When you do this, you will see the newly created faction added to the Current Factions list. You can add or remove factions at anytime. The default factions that are included do not have to be used.
